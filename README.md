# Final_project
The start of my final project learning web development with skillhat.
This repository houses the codes to my first professional portfolio page which I will be hosting on GitHub pages.
In this assignment, you will rebuild your portfolio page, adding on new techniques that were
learned from this week's set of lessons.
You can then add demonstrative exercises to as links off your portfolio page as you go through
the course.
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or
full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought
processes behind it.
